162.Count the Number of Consistent Strings

CODE:

class Solution:
    def countConsistentStrings(self, allowed: str, words: List[str]) -> int:
        c=0
        for i in words:
            for j in i:
                if j not in allowed:
                    c+=1
                    break 
        return len(words)-c

OUTPUT:


Example 1:

Input: allowed = "ab", words = ["ad","bd","aaab","baa","badab"]
Output: 2
Explanation: Strings "aaab" and "baa" are consistent since they only contain characters 'a' and 'b'.
Example 2:

Input: allowed = "abc", words = ["a","b","c","ab","ac","bc","abc"]
Output: 7
Explanation: All strings are consistent.
Example 3:

Input: allowed = "cad", words = ["cc","acd","b","ba","bac","bad","ac","d"]
Output: 4
