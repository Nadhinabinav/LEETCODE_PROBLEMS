37.Check if a String Is an Acronym of Words

CODE:

class Solution(object):
    def isAcronym(self, words, s):
        z=""
        for i in range(len(words)):
            z+=words[i][0]
        if s==z:
            return True
        else:
            return False    

        

OUTPUT:

Example 1:

Input: words = ["alice","bob","charlie"], s = "abc"
Output: true
Explanation: The first character in the words "alice", "bob", and "charlie" are 'a', 'b', and 'c', respectively. Hence, s = "abc" is the acronym. 
Example 2:

Input: words = ["an","apple"], s = "a"
Output: false
Explanation: The first character in the words "an" and "apple" are 'a' and 'a', respectively. 
The acronym formed by concatenating these characters is "aa". 
Hence, s = "a" is not the acronym.
Example 3:

Input: words = ["never","gonna","give","up","on","you"], s = "ngguoy"
Output: true
Explanation: By concatenating the first character of the words in the array, we get the string "ngguoy". 
Hence, s = "ngguoy" is the acronym.
