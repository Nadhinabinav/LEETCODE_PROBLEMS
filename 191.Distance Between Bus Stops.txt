191.Distance Between Bus Stops

CODE:

class Solution:
    def distanceBetweenBusStops(self, distance: List[int], start: int, destination: int) -> int:
        if start > destination:
            start, destination = destination, start
        clockwise_distance = sum(distance[start:destination])

        total_distance = sum(distance)

        counterclockwise_distance = total_distance - clockwise_distance
        shortest_distance = min(clockwise_distance, counterclockwise_distance)
        return (shortest_distance)
            

OUTPUT:

Input: distance = [1,2,3,4], start = 0, destination = 1
Output: 1
