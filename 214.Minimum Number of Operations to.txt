214.Minimum Number of Operations to Make Elements in Array Distinct

CODE:

class Solution:
    def minimumOperations(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        operations = 0
        while len(nums) != len(set(nums)):
            nums = nums[3:] 
            operations += 1
        return operations

OUTPUT:

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,2,3,3,5,7]

Output: 2


Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,4,4]

Output: 2
