CODE:

class Solution(object):
    def finalValueAfterOperations(self, operations):
        c=0
        for i in operations:
            if (i=='++X'or i=='X++'):
                c=c+1
            elif(i=='--X' or i=='X--'):
                c=c-1
        return c
        

OUTPUT:

Example 1:

Input: operations = ["--X","X++","X++"]
Output: 1

Example 2:

Input: operations = ["++X","++X","X++"]
