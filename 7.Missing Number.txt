7.Missing Number

CODE:

class Solution(object):
    def missingNumber(self, nums):
        a=0
        while a in nums:
            a+=1
        return a


OUTPUT:

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2

Example 3:

Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
