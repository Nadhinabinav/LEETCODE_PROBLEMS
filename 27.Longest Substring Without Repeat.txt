27.Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

CODE:

class Solution(object):
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s):
        res_set=set()
        res=0
        l=0
        for i in range(0,len(s)):
            while s[i]in res_set:
                res_set.remove(s[l])
                l+=1
            res_set.add(s[i])
            res=max(res,i-l+1)
        return res

OUTPUT:


Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
